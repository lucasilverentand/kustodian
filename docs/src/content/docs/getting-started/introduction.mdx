description: What is Kustodian and why should you use it?

Kustodian is a **GitOps templating framework** for Kubernetes that generates [Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/) manifests in real-time. Unlike traditional approaches that require generating and committing manifests, Kustodian produces Flux Kustomizations on-the-fly during reconciliation—keeping your repository clean and your workflow simple.

## The Problem

Managing Kubernetes clusters at scale presents several challenges:

- **Generated manifest bloat**: Traditional tools require generating and committing manifests, cluttering your repository
- **Configuration duplication**: Similar applications deployed across clusters require copy-pasting manifests
- **Inconsistent node setups**: Nodes with similar purposes end up with different labels and taints
- **Complex dependencies**: Applications depend on each other, but managing deployment order is manual
- **GitOps complexity**: Setting up Flux CD Kustomizations with proper health checks and namespaces is tedious

## The Solution

Kustodian generates manifests in-time, meaning you only commit your source configuration—not the generated output. This provides:

### Reusable Templates

Define an application deployment once as a template, then deploy it to any cluster with customizable values:

```yaml
# templates/monitoring/template.yaml
apiVersion: kustodian.io/v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: monitoring
spec:
  kustomizations:
    - name: prometheus
      path: ./prometheus
      depends_on:
        - kustomization: cert-manager/cert-manager
      namespace:
        default: monitoring
```

### Node Profiles

Create reusable configurations for node labels, taints, and annotations:

```yaml
# node-profiles/storage-node.yaml
apiVersion: kustodian.io/v1
kind: NodeProfile
metadata:
  name: storage-node
spec:
  labels:
    storage: nvme
    storage-tier: high-performance
  taints:
    - key: storage
      effect: NoSchedule
```

### Automatic Dependency Resolution

Kustodian builds a dependency graph from your templates and:
- Detects circular dependencies before deployment
- Computes the correct deployment order
- Validates all references exist

### Flux CD Integration

Generates production-ready Flux Kustomizations with:
- Proper `dependsOn` relationships
- Health checks for readiness
- Namespace creation
- Source references

### Node Management with k0s

Kustodian manages Kubernetes nodes primarily through [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/), a lightweight, certified Kubernetes distribution. Bootstrap and configure your cluster nodes directly from your configuration:

```bash
kustodian bootstrap --cluster production
kustodian apply --cluster production
```

## How It Works

1. **Define templates** for your applications in `templates/`
2. **Configure clusters** in `clusters/<name>/cluster.yaml`
3. **Define nodes** with optional profiles in `clusters/<name>/nodes/`
4. **Commit and push**—Kustodian generates Flux manifests automatically during reconciliation

No generate step. No committing generated files. Just your source configuration.
